1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:13,089
In the great sea of Ignora lay
five islands in the shape of a cross.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,329
Four pointed in each cardinal direction
around a larger one in the center

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,030
to form Ente Isla, the islands
watched over by the gods.

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,469
All who lived in Ente Isla
knew of Satan, ruler of demons.

5
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,339
His very name was synonymous
with the terror and cruelty

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,370
which ruled this demon realm
teeming with creatures of the night.

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,449
Satan's ambition was to
conquer the human world

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,950
and build there a land of peace and
prosperity for all night's creatures.

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,029
He had four trusted generals:

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,969
Adramelech, Lucifer, Alciel, and Malacoda.

11
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,700
These four great demons launched
attacks on the four continents.

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,410
However, a lone hero rose up
against them, sacred sword in hand.

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,749
Along with a band of comrades, the hero
crushed Lucifer's army to the west.

14
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,429
They went on to defeat Adramelech in
the north and Malacoda in the south,

15
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,529
and then the federation
of knights led by this hero

16
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,900
invaded the central continent, where
the lord of demons kept his castle.

17
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,040
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Damn! You wretched humans!

18
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,750
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&\i1}Divine souls, gather in the realm of the
dead. Stop the demons and drag them to the netherworld!

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}What?!

20
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,010
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}How dare you!

21
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,790
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Sire!

22
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,710
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Out of my way!

23
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,840
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I am sorry, Sire.

24
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,140
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}The human forces are
steadily overcoming my army.

25
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,560
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}lt is only a matter
of time before this castle falls.

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,439
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I never
dreamed a single human "hero"

27
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,110
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}could force
us into such dire straits...

28
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,450
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Sire,

29
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,870
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I suggest we withdraw for
now and regroup.

30
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,290
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Hear me, humans!

31
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,550
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I shall leave
Ente Isla in your hands today!

32
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,009
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}But know this: I shall return

33
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,010
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}to subjugate
you and all of Ente Isla!

34
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,480
{\fad(350,500)\an1\fscx88\pos(100,400)\3c&H000000&}The Devil <font color="#bf1a95">Arrives</font><font color="#ffffff"> in Sasazuka</font>

35
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,529
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Where are we?!

36
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,359
-{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Are you all right, Sire?

37
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,000
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Alciel, the first thing
we must do is find a place to heal.

38
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Yes, Sire.

39
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:37,660
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}But this seems
an awfully noisy place...

40
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,090
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Wh-What is this world?!

41
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,020
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Could it...

42
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:55,560
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Sire?! Why
do you take that form?!

43
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,979
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}What?

44
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,270
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}These are...

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,770
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}...human hands?

46
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,450
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Calm yourself, Alciel.

47
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,249
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}We must be
careful not to use magic.

48
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,959
Excuse me, you there!

49
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
Could I talk to you for a minute?

50
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,920
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Do not speak to
me so familiarly, lowly human!

51
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,000
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Do you wish to die?

52
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,769
Uh-oh, they're foreigners.

53
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,969
Okay, do you boys understand Japanese?

54
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,440
You look injured. Were you in a fight?

55
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,549
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Why?! Even if
they do not speak our language,

56
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,099
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I am a demon, a user of magic...

57
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,100
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Alciel.

58
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,310
Do not use your magic now.
Not until we learn of this world.

59
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,659
Aren't they hot, dressed like that?

60
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,189
They're "cosplaying," Sir. Don't see
that much in this neighborhood, though.

61
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,870
This is Sasaki on patrol duty. I've got
some boys with minor injuries here.

62
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:58,790
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}This seems to be a carriage...

63
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,039
The victims are foreigners
from somewhere in Asia.

64
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,540
We're in west Shinjuku, area 1-20.

65
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,210
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}But it doesn't require horses...

66
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,175
Not sure whether they're
tourists or residents.

67
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:07,250
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}lt doesn't
seem to be powered by magic...

68
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Now, can I get you to join us
in the car? If nothing's wrong...

69
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,930
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Do not presume
to touch me, lowly human!

70
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,430
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Know your
place, you inferior creature!

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,390
Okay, you two behave yourselves.

72
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,479
Um, this is <i>katsudon,</i> okay?

73
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,479
<i>Katsu... don...</i>

74
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,470
Yes, yes.

75
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,849
They coated animal flesh in some
sort of grain and fried it in hot oil.

76
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,359
Then they put a mashed-up bird egg on top,

77
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,229
and heated it even further
in a fish broth...

78
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,729
I'm not actually supposed to feed you,

79
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,500
but you two are injured,
so we'll just call it my treat.

80
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,820
<i>{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&\i1}I want more
information about this world.</i>

81
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,109
What? Oh, yes.

82
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,240
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Answer my questions.

83
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,730
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Alciel.

84
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,040
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Alciel?

85
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Satan!

86
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,230
H-Hey, you can't just come in here!

87
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,250
<i>{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&\i1}Silence.</i>

88
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,260
Y-Yes, Sir...

89
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,470
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}King Satan...

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,300
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I'm so glad you're all right.

91
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,980
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I used hypnotism to gain
some information about this world...

92
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,409
Apparently we've come to
a world called "Earth."

93
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,449
We're in one of its nations,
an archipelago called "Japan."

94
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,449
We stand now in its capital of "Tokyo,"

95
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,989
and this building is someplace
called a "police station."

96
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,059
The police are evidently a state
institution which maintains public order.

97
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,569
I see. And what is that
substance on the table?

98
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,239
"Katsu Doon." It's an extremely
common food in this country.

99
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,309
"Katsu Doon"...

100
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,979
Yes, that has a powerful ring to it.
This is of great interest.

101
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,849
What? N-No, it's not
particularly important.

102
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,149
In this world, things like spell-casting,
magic, demons, and the Devil

103
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,189
are considered fantasies...
things that don't really exist.

104
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,420
Magic doesn't exist?! How could that be?!

105
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,329
I see, so the insufficient magic here

106
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,269
left us unable to retain our demonic forms?

107
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,009
Yes. But who would have thought we'd
look like <i>this</i> stripped of our magic...

108
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,379
Perhaps humans actually form
the basis of all living creatures.

109
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,349
You jest, Sire.

110
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,349
I'm sure it's merely an effect
of this world and the Gate.

111
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,019
I still retain some of my magic.

112
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,289
It's quite an effort to stem
its outward flow, though.

113
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,060
What about you, Alciel?

114
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,909
King Satan, is this?

115
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,079
No, I highly doubt you
conjured this with magic.

116
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,340
Oh.

117
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,389
If I adjust the amount of magic
I release, I won't run out for a while.

118
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,659
The real problem is that we
have no way to amass more.

119
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,589
Still, if Earth is familiar with the
concept of magic, even as "imaginary,"

120
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,199
there may be some method
of recovering our powers.

121
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,099
The path left to us is to discover
that method and get them back.

122
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,239
Until then, we have no choice

123
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,569
but to live in this world
and obey these humans' rules.

124
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,079
What a cruel reality this is.

125
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,910
Yes. Our first step is...

126
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,910
to obtain "records" and "certificates
of residence" at this "ward office."

127
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,000
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Sire...

128
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,229
H-Hmm?

129
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,200
Here.

130
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,640
{\an8}"Sadao Maou"
"Head of Household"

131
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:24,529
All right. Next, we create
accounts at the "bank."

132
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,439
To do so, we use this.

133
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,139
What is that paper?

134
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,039
It's this country's currency.

135
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,439
I borrowed it from that police person.

136
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,479
We also need a seal.
I whipped one up for myself.

137
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,585
Most impressive.

138
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,490
{\an8}"Lifelong Safe Trust"
"Super Fixed Deposit"

139
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,949
Here you are.

140
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:44,290
Good. Now we just need to secure
a base of operations from a "real-tore."

141
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,770
<font size="72">Realtor</font>

142
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,619
We are searching house!

143
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,660
What sort of home do you have in mind, Sir?

144
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:51,999
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}He understood you!

145
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,210
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}C-Calm down, Alciel!

146
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,960
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}A little language
acquisition is nothing for me!

147
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,050
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}O-Okay! I'm in the groove here!

148
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,149
The landlady here is a
very admirable person.

149
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,279
If I may speak frankly,
she says she wants to set an example

150
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,920
by taking on persons of
unknown background, like you.

151
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,900
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Th-This is...

152
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,279
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Yes. Even I can tell...

153
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,119
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Well, at least
it's a two-story house...

154
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,990
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}And it has six rooms.

155
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,619
You'd be renting room 201 here.

156
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,870
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}We get <i>one</i> room?

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,669
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}I suppose we
should be grateful it has a roof...

158
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,390
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Certainly when you compare
it to the Devil's Castle, it's a bit...

159
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,310
Good afternoon.

160
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,550
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}ls it... human?

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,219
You two are the new rental
applicants, correct?

162
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}lt spoke?!

163
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,019
This is the apartment owner.
She lives next door.

164
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,159
I am Miki Shiba.

165
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,199
That's "Miki" spelled with the
kanji for "beauty" and "radiance."

166
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,989
Oh, but do feel free to call me "Mikitty."

167
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,410
{\an8\c&HAAAAAA&}Right...

168
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,209
Sire, are you sure this is
the right place for us?

169
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,809
It seems that in this world
they say "patience is a virtue."

170
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,649
This style of Devil's Castle
will make a nice change.

171
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,340
Oh, Sire...

172
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,419
From here, we shall take
a new step... for... ward...

173
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,529
King Satan! King Satan!

174
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,769
King Satan!

176
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,499
I didn't realize this body required food!

177
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,739
It <i>is</i> a human body, Sire.

178
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,279
Not to mention that "IV drip" thing
cost a full month's rent on the castle!

179
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,509
You know what they call that here?
"Rubbing salt into a wound"!

180
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,589
Sire, that uncanny landlady
spared us a good deal of trouble.

181
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,089
She tells me that Japan requires
residents to carry health ins...

182
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,789
Anyway! Money is clearly of
the essence in this human society.

183
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,429
I can't afford to expend any
more of my magic, either.

184
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,429
Which means we have only one choice left.

185
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,400
What is that, Sire?

186
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,539
Whoops, I did it wrong.

187
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,439
You idiot! Résumé forms
don't grow on trees, you know!

Okay, I'm "Sadao Maou"...

189
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,819
"Shiro Ashiya" ...Do you think
this name is strange, Sire?

190
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,580
It's too late to ask me that!
We already made IDs!

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,999
King Satan.

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,139
Yeah?

193
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,909
Might I suggest you put a little
more thought into your spending?

194
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,779
I'm thinking plenty!
Summer's coming, so we need a fridge,

195
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,809
and owning a laundry machine is
cheaper than coin laundry in the long run.

196
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,249
The bike is essential
for commuting to work.

197
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,489
That's not the issue, Sire!

198
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,989
I'm questioning why you
didn't pay in installments.

199
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,689
I hate loans.

200
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,029
Now look here...

201
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,659
And installment plans
come with fees, you know!

202
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,669
I ain't paying for something
I can't touch with my own hands!

203
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,999
In that case, let me ask you this:

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,869
How are we supposed to make it to payday
on milk, konjac jelly, and cucumbers?!

205
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,009
Well...

206
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,009
It's not like we've got <i>no</i> money left!

207
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,319
I've still got some in my wallet!

208
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
And hey, they give me meals at work!

209
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,689
We'll die.

210
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,859
You propose we eat burgers and fries
three times a day until payday?!

211
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,830
What is this, <i>Super Size Me?</i>

212
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:46,629
You plan to eat a high-calorie,
high-cholesterol diet from a young age?

213
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,300
I look forward to ten years from now!

214
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,729
I just hope you don't die prematurely of a
lifestyle-related illness before we get home!

215
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,799
I must apologize for my cowardice, Sire,

216
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,069
but you're the one who
argued for biding our time!

217
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,569
You of all people ought to prize constant
diligence and health maintenance!

218
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,699
Put a sock in it! I'm going to work!

219
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,640
Wait, Sire!

220
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:56,869
Lecture me later!

221
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,309
No, I mean you forgot your umbrella!

222
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,300
Let's go, Dullahan!

223
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,140
Well, I suppose I'll get ready too.

A cheeseburger and a small cola.

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,659

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,179
Uh, what?

327
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,450
Sadao Maou, as of today,
I'm promoting you to A-level staff.

328
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,689
All <i>right!</i>

329
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,850
I'm A-level staff, Ashiya! I got a raise!

330
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,470
Hey.

331
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,929
Huh? Oh, it's you.

332
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,369
I went to your restaurant after we spoke.

333
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,409
Oh, you did? I didn't see you.
You should've said something!

334
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,209
I watched you all day from
the bookstore across the street.

335
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,619
You look so different that
I thought I was mistaken, but...

336
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,789
You started to cast a spell.

337
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,450
A spell?

338
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,220
Wait, are you...?!

339
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,659
Why exactly are you working
part-time at MgRonald's, Satan?!

340
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,830
Emilia the hero?!

341
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,669
<i>Where will morning start
from, in this quiet sky?</i>

342
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,309
<i>Fingertips twining in a pinky
swear I pretended not to see</i>

343
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:41,310
<i>If the moon's been laughed at,
she'll sink away toward yesterday</i>

344
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,419
<i>Liar, coward... if I'm
all these things at once</i>

345
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,159
<i>Then I only blossomed in dreams</i>

346
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,699
<i>I hid in the moon's shadow,
but the truth is, I was crying</i>

347
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,409
<i>The tears won't flow anymore...
did they all dry up?</i>

348
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:12,949
<i>If I could forgive everything,
maybe they'd flow again</i>

349
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,290
<i>But these are all things I want to protect</i>
